Previously I was a Rails freelancer, hands-on project lead and now I'm employeed as a Senior Back-end Developer.

Mainly working on improving my #golang skills and contributing to open source in free time.

I'm open to interesting collaborations and other offers, reach out to **github(at)skatkov(dot)com** if you would like to talk.
