Previously I was a Rails freelancer, hands-on project lead, bootstraped a SaaS and now I'm employeed as a Senior Back-end Developer.

Now I'm mainly working on improving #golang skills and contributing to open source.

I'm open to interesting collaborations and other offers, reach out to **github(at)skatkov(dot)com** if you would like to talk. 

âš¡ Fun fact: I started out as QA engineer in IT, so I take testing seriously :)


Stay awesome, people!
